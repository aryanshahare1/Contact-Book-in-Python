# Contact-Book in Python

I developed a Contact Book application in Python that streamlines the management of personal contacts. This command-line tool enables users to create, view, update, delete, search, and count contacts efficiently.

# Key Features:

Create Contact: Add new contacts with essential details, ensuring no duplicates are allowed.

View Contact: Access contact information quickly by name.

Update Contact: Modify existing contact details seamlessly.

Delete Contact: Remove contacts effortlessly.

Search Contact: Find contacts using names, emails, or mobile numbers.

Count Contacts: Get a quick overview of the total number of contacts stored.
